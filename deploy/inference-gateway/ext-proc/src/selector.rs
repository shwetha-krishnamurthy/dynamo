//! In-process, runtime-free worker selector.
//!
//! Standalone mode runs the runtime-free selection service **in-process**: the
//! EPP and a [`SelectionService`] are compiled into one binary and the EPP calls
//! the selector's Rust API directly — no HTTP client, no second Deployment.
//!
//! With `DYN_EPP_PEER_SERVICE` set, [`Selector`] enables the service's
//! replica-sync and starts a [`crate::peer_discovery`] watch of the EPP's own
//! Service, so replicated EPP pods discover their siblings and sync active load
//! over ZMQ (admission / prefill-complete / free). Without it, a single replica
//! runs fully local.
//!
//! This module also owns the small plain types the reflector → topology adapter →
//! router pipeline speaks ([`WorkerRegistration`], [`SelectRequest`],
//! [`SelectResponse`]); the selector maps them to the selection service's own
//! public request/response types (no JSON in the hot path).
